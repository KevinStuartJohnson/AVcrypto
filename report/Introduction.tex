%Describe curves in general

% In recent years there has been increased interest in public key cryptography . The use of elliptic curves in cryptography was suggested independently by {\color{red} Neal Koblitz and Victor S. Miller in 1985 and have entered wide use in 2004 to 2005}. In this report we give explicit descriptions for algorithms need to implement public key cryptosystems using abelian varieties.
